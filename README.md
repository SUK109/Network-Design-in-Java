# Network-Design-in-Java - This repository contains Java code for etwork design software. As input, software receives the number of nodes (N=25), the traffic demand values (bij)
# between pairs of nodes, and the unit cost values for the potential links (aij). The program
# generates the network topology with capacities assigned to each link and also computes
# the total cost, shortest path cost and density of the network.
